    "Let's start building a dataset for our text analysis. We’ll be using some resources published by ITHAKA, which you might not have heard of, but JSTOR, which you probably have heard of, is one of their organizations. They have a brand new resource called Constellate that allows you to build and analyze datasets and perform text analysis on their materials (32 million documents!). They’ve been developing some really useful resources for text analysis, which are still in sort of a beta mode, and so we’re one of the groups that get to experiment with these.  \n",

    "<i>Hint: Building a coherent dataset is key to any text analysis. If you're just exploring, we recommend building a very tight, subject specific dataset. You can do this with some robust keyword filtering, but you might also want to focus on one or two titles. The publications in Reveal Digital are often very narrow and using one of those publications as a source can provide interesting and informative results.</i>\n",

You can also create a shareable URL directly to the visualization from that menu.  \n",
